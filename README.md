# digital-diary-app

Self-selected project from High School Data Structures class. First project in Swift and SwiftUI, all from self-taught knowledge.

## What does it do?

The prompt for this project was to create an application on any platform that served as a contacts and reminder app, and that is exactly what it does. There are two tabs, one for contacts and one for reminders. In each tab, you can add, edit, or delete contacts/reminders.

## Prerequisites

To be able to open this project you must have a MacOS system with XCode installed. 

## Installation on iPhone

This app can be installed through XCode with a developer account, or alternatively, with [AltStore](https://altstore.io/) (method used in development).

### Additional information / Notes

This project was created from scratch over the course of 3 weeks, so the formatting is not necessarily optimal. I am publishing this about a year after completion and am currently enrolled in an iOS development course, so I am using this project to show where I started. I think it is a wonderful first iOS project, and I look forward to working on more like it in the future.
